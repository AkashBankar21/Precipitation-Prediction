Project Code: DA-08

We want to predict the amount of precipitation(rain) given the weather
attributes for a particular day using regression analysis. Split the dataset into
training and testing sets and report the RMSE and R-2 score for each regression
problem mentioned below.
1. Are there any missing values, NaN present in this dataset? What are
steps that you have taken to handle the same? Write about the same in
the report in detail.
2. Use simple linear regression to predict ‘Precip’ utilizing individual
weather attributes as mentioned before.
3. Use multiple linear regression to predict ‘Precip’ utilizing all the weather
attributes.
4. Use nonlinear regression with order 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to predict the
‘Precip’ and compare all the results through scatter plots or other plots.
